# AWS RDS PostgreSQL Operator Guide

Configuration Presets:

* Development - PostgreSQL 14 on 2 vCPUs, 4 GiB RAM, 100GiB SSD Disk. No deletion protection, single day backups est cost $51/mo

* Production - PostgreSQL 14 on 8 vCPUs, 64 GiB RAM, 100GiB IO1 w/ disk allocation scaling to 1000GiB w/ 2000 IOPS. Deletion protection, 30 day backups and snapshots

Design Decisions:

* A 10 character password is automatically generated for your "root" account
* Auto minor version upgrade enabled
* Auto major version upgrade disabled
* A default database _is not created_
* publicly_accessible is disabled, instances run on private subnets
* encryption is enabled w/ a custom KMS key
* tags are copied to snapshots
* a subnet group is created for the database
* a security group is created for the database
* some instance types (e.g: db.t2.micro) aren't supported since they do not support encryption
* monitoring
  * cpu_utilization_threshold    = > 90%
  * disk_queue_depth_threshold   = 64
  * free_storage_space_threshold = < 10% of allocated or max allocated (if set)
  * freeable_memory_threshold = < 10% of instance
  * swap_usage_threshold      = > 10% of instance  memory
* enhanced monitoring role is created if monitoring enabled
* performance insights using custom KMS if enabled
* expose cloudwatch logs export
